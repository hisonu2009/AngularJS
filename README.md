What is AngularJS

AngularJS is a very powerful JavaScript Framework. It is used in Single Page Application (SPA) projects. It extends HTML DOM with additional attributes and makes it more responsive to user actions. AngularJS is open source, completely free, and used by thousands of developers around the world. It is licensed under the Apache license version 2.0.

Features

* AngularJS is a powerful JavaScript based development framework to create RICH Internet Application(RIA).
* AngularJS provides developers options to write client side application (using JavaScript) in a clean MVC(Model View Controller) way.
* Application written in AngularJS is cross-browser compliant. AngularJS automatically handles JavaScript code suitable for each browser.
* AngularJS is open source, completely free, and used by thousands of developers around the world. It is licensed under the Apache License version 2.0.


AngularJS MVC
Model View Controller or MVC as it is popularly called, is a software design pattern for developing web applications. A Model View Controller pattern is made up of the following three parts −

Model − It is the lowest level of the pattern responsible for maintaining data.
View − It is responsible for displaying all or a portion of the data to the user.
Controller − It is a software Code that controls the interactions between the Model and View.
MVC is popular because it isolates the application logic from the user interface layer and supports separation of concerns. The controller receives all requests for the application and then works with the model to prepare any data needed by the view. The view then uses the data prepared by the controller to generate a final presentable response. The MVC abstraction can be graphically represented as follows.


Core Features
Data-binding − It is the automatic synchronization of data between model and view components.
Scope − These are objects that refer to the model. They act as a glue between controller and view.
Controller − These are JavaScript functions that are bound to a particular scope.
Services − AngularJS come with several built-in services for example $http to make a XMLHttpRequests. These are singleton objects which are instantiated only once in app.
Filters − These select a subset of items from an array and returns a new array.
Directives − Directives are markers on DOM elements (such as elements, attributes, css, and more). These can be used to create custom HTML tags that serve as new, custom widgets. AngularJS has built-in directives (ngBind, ngModel...)


Advantages of AngularJS
AngularJS provides capability to create Single Page Application in a very clean and maintainable way.
AngularJS provides data binding capability to HTML thus giving user a rich and responsive experience
AngularJS code is unit testable.
AngularJS uses dependency injection and make use of separation of concerns.
AngularJS provides reusable components.
With AngularJS, developer write less code and get more functionality.
In AngularJS, views are pure html pages, and controllers written in JavaScript do the business processing.


AngularJS Components
The AngularJS framework can be divided into following three major parts −
ng-app − This directive defines and links an AngularJS application to HTML.
ng-model − This directive binds the values of AngularJS application data to HTML input controls.
ng-bind − This directive binds the AngularJS Application data to HTML tags.
